**Where does the name "Stratifyd" come from?**

  Stratifyd is a unique way of spelling Stratified Sampling, which is a statistical method that illustrates the peeling of layers and layers of data to derive a proper statistical result. We took the name Stratifyd to emphasize next-gen Data Analytics that will be mathematically sound and interpretable by humans. This truly reflects our company mission on providing an Augmented Intelligence environment that leverages Artificial Intelligence to Augment Human's Decision Making process. 

  For more reading on Stratified: In statistics, stratified sampling is a method of sampling from a population. In statistical surveys, when subpopulations within an overall population vary, it is advantageous to sample each subpopulation (stratum) independently.
