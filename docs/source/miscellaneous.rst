We are a group of data scientists and PhDs from universities, thus we support students expanding their analytics horizon by providing free access to advanced technologies.

Feel free to drop us a line with your EDU account at clientsupport@stratifyd.com. Our specialists will be more than happy to create an account for you.

If you are a lecturer or professor who wants to use Signals in your classroom, please contact us and we will be happy to arrange licenses for your students. Feel free to drop us a line at clientsupport@stratifyd.com.
