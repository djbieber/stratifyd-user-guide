If you're bringing your own data, specify which fields contain Textual, Temporal, or Geographical information for analysis and normalization. All other fields will be brought in as pivot points and additional visualizations. See the :doc:`mapdata` guide for more details.

Create visualizations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Your dashboard will contain visualizations based on the type of data in your analysis by default. See the guide on our :doc:`signalsanalyticsengine` for information on how to interpret these visualizations. Every visualization is clickable, and clicking will apply a filter on your data based on your selection.

Now you're ready to :doc:`widgeteditor` using your other datapoints to home in on interesting segments within your data and discover topics and themes within your textual data.



Find meaningful insights
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let the visualizations guide your analysis. Click on areas of interest to drill-down into subsets of data

Click on the "Data" tab to view the original documents. If you've filtered down to a subset of your data in your dashboard, you'll see only those documents.


Share your results

Make your dashboard public or :ref:`share` with colleagues.
